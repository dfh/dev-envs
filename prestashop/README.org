* PrestaShop development environment

Used to test/develop PrestaShop stuff.

Notes:

- Database =prestashop-dev=, user =root= with blank password.
- Nginx serves =/var/www/shared-folder=.
- PHP runs as =admin:admin= so that it can write to
  =/var/www/shared-folder=.
- PHP =mysql.so= installed and loaded in =php.ini=.
- PHP GD extension installed (=php5-gd=) and loaded in =php.ini=.
- PrestaShop login: =david@hgbrg.se/testtest=
- Had to increase fastcgi buffer sizes for auth to work, see =nginx.conf=.
