* Generic WordPress development environment

Used to test/develop WordPress stuff.

I don't like WP much. But somehow it seems impossible to avoid it.

Notes:

- Database =wp-dev=, user =root= with blank password.
- Nginx serves =/var/www/shared-folder=.
- PHP runs as =admin:admin= so that it can write to
  =/var/www/shared-folder=.
- WordPress username: =admin=, password: =admin=.
